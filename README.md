# Web Development Project 5 - *Pokémon Dashboard*

Submitted by: **Pratik Patil**

This web app: **A React-based dashboard that fetches and displays Pokémon data from the PokéAPI, allowing users to search and filter through Pokémon information**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The site has a dashboard displaying a list of data fetched using an API call**
  - The dashboard displays 100 unique Pokémon, one per row
  - Each row includes Pokémon image, name, type, height, and base experience
- [x] **`useEffect` React hook and `async`/`await` are used**
  - useEffect is used to fetch data when the component mounts
  - async/await is used for API calls to PokéAPI
- [x] **The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data** 
  - The app dashboard includes the following statistics:
    - Total number of Pokémon displayed
    - Average base experience across all Pokémon
    - Total number of unique Pokémon types
- [x] **A search bar allows the user to search for an item in the fetched data**
  - The search bar correctly filters Pokémon by name
  - The list of results dynamically updates as the user types into the search bar
- [x] **An additional filter allows the user to restrict displayed items by specified categories**
  - The filter restricts Pokémon by type, which is different from the name search
  - The filter correctly displays only Pokémon matching the selected type
  - The dashboard list dynamically updates as the user adjusts the type filter

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously
- [x] Filters use different input types
  - Text input for the search bar
  - Dropdown selection for the type filter
- [ ] The user can enter specific bounds for filter values

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices
* [x] Visual type badges that are color-coded based on Pokémon type
* [x] Loading state displayed while fetching data

## Notes

Challenges encountered while building the app:
- Managing the complex nested structure of the PokéAPI responses
- Implementing proper error handling for API requests
- Optimizing performance when fetching detailed data for multiple Pokémon
- Creating a responsive design that works well on different screen sizes
